Exercises

Use the commands above to complete the following tasks, and submit the SQL statements. 
Real-world examples must be distinct from those used in the text.

1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.

  adding = INSERT INTO
    Example: INSERT INTO products (id, name, price)
  VALUES
  (11773, 'South Face Jacket', 174.99),
  (11774, 'Big Mountain 2-Person Tent', 219.99),
  (11775, 'King Cole Camp Stove', 34.99),
  (11776, 'Oregon Trail Mountain Bike', 579.99);

  updating = UPDATE
    Example: UPDATE products SET price=159.99 WHERE id=11773;

  deleting = DELETE
    Example: DELETE FROM products WHERE id=11776;


2. Explain the structure for each type of command.

  INSERT INTO
    Example: INSERT INTO <tablename> (<columnName1>,<columnName2>,<columnName3>)
    VALUES
    (<column1Value>, <column2Value>, <column3Value>);

  INSERT INTO specifies the action of adding.
    It is then followed by the <tablename>
    (<columnName1>,<columnName2>,<columnName3>) Specify which columns values should be added to.
    VALUES is followed by what specific values are going to be added.


  UPDATE
    Example: UPDATE <tablename> SET <columnDescription>=<updatedValue> WHERE <row>;

    UPDATE begins the command.
    The <tablename> for the update is listed.
    The columnDescription is stated with the value that the data will be updated to.
    WHERE denotes which row the update will be happening.


  DELETE
    Example: DELETE FROM <tablename> WHERE <uniqueValue>;

    DELETE begins the command.
    FROM <tablename> states the table where the action should be performed.
    WHERE specifics the row using an <uniqueValue>   It is always a good idea to use a column
    with a unique value in the WHERE clause, or to specify multiple criteria. This is good practice
    because otherwise you can accidentally delete other rows.

3. What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example 
of each type.

- String data types:  text   example: 'Assignment Name' (used in School for grades)

- Number data types: integer or int  example: Students grades: 94, 88, 91

- Date data types: datetime     example: Record the date and time when a student's grade was entered

4. Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. 
The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number 
of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

- Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?
    - First and last name. - String
    - Whether they sent in their RSVP. - Boolean
    - Number of guests. - Integer
    - Number of meals. - Numeric (float or decimal)

- Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.

        CREATE TABLE wedding (
            firstName text,
            lastName text,
            RSVP text,
            numberOfGuests integer,
            mealNumber(3, 1)
        );

- Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.

        ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN thankYouCard text;

- You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command 
to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.

        ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN mealNumber;

- The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a 
column for table number.

        ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN tableNumber integer;

- The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command 
that deletes the table numbers from the database.

        ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN tableNumber;

5. Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns 
ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.

        CREATE TABLE library (
            ISBN varchar,
            title text,
            author text,
            genre text,
            publishingDate date,
            numberOfCopies integer,
            availableCopies integer
        );

- Find three books and add their information to the table.

        INSERT INTO library (ISBN, title, author, genre, publishingDate, numberOfCopies, availableCopies)
        VALUES
        (9780735219090, 'Where the Crawdads Sing', 'Delia Owens', 'Mystery', 2018-08-14, 4, 4),
        (9781432850661, 'Then She Was Gone', 'Lisa Jewell', 'Thriller', 2017-07-27, 3, 2),
        (9780718084225, 'The Hideaway', 'Lauren K. Denton', 'Romance', 2017-04-11, 2, 0);

- Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies 
to 1 fewer.

        UPDATE library SET availableCopies = availableCopies WHERE ISBN= '9780735219090';

- Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.

        DELETE FROM library WHERE ISBN= "9780718084225';

6. Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, 
name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, 
if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. In addition to the 
table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

        CREATE TABLE spacecrafts (
            id varchar,
            name text,
            yearLaunched integer,
            country text,
            mission text,
            orbitingBody text,
            operatingStatus text,
            milesFromEarth bigint
        );

- Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.

        ('2001-014A', 'Mars Odyssey', 2001, 'USA', 'Map the surface of Mars', 'Mars', 'Active', 285000000),
        ('1977-084A', 'Voyager 1', 1977, 'USA', 'Investigate Jupiter and Saturn', 'None: Currently interstellar space', 'Active', 13048795036),
        ('2006-001A', New Horizons, 2006, 'USA', 'Investigate Pluto and Charon', 'Charon', 'Active', 4074330000);
-Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.

        DELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id= '1977-084A';

-Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect 
that.

        UPDATE spacecrafts SET operatingStatus= 'Inactive' WHERE id= '2001-014A';

7. Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table 
should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body 
of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the 
email chain it's in. Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

CREATE TABLE email_inbox (
    id varchar,
    subject text,
    sender varchar,
    additionalRecipients varchar,
    body text,
    timeSent timestamp,
    status text,
    emailChainId varchar
);

-Add three new emails to the inbox.

        INSERT INTO email_inbox (id, subject, sender, additionalRecipients, body, timeSent, status, emailChainId)
        VALUES
        ('100001', 'Community Clothing Drive', 'ccd@gmail.com', 'unknown', 'I need additional volunteers to help 
        with our annual Community Clothng Drive. If you can help out that day it would be much appreciated. Lunch 
        will be provided. Thank you.', '2019-05-05 06:32:49', 'read', 'https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=wm#inbox/FMfcgxwCgVWtxVLJnLBcPbCcvhZsJmJD' );

        ('100002', 'Appliance Repair', 'kenny@rockymtnappliance', 'unknown', 'I was able to finish the repair of your dryer. 
        Everything seems to working properly at this point. There is a 30 day warranty on all repairs. Please let 
        me know if I can be of service in any other way. Thanks, Kenny','2019-05-04 09:52:23', 'read','https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=wm#search/bloc/FMfcgxwCgVWsjbwqkPBcwrtbwmsmWrJH' ),

        ('100003', 'Power Outage', 'info@excelenergy.com', 'unknown', 'We regret to inform you that there is a local
        power outage in you area. We assure you we are working quickly to resolve the problem and will report back to
        you shortly when we have an estimated time of restoration.', '2019-02-17 10:06:53', 'https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=wm#sent/FMfcgxwBVgsZwNJgvRqPFfvQNxfSdRpj');

-You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox 
table.

    DELETE FROM email_inbox WHERE id= '100001';

-You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as 
unread before investigating the crash, so you can come back and read it later.

UPDATE email_inbox SET status= 'unread' WHERE id= '100002';
